- 👋 Hi, I’m @annanurov
- 👀 I’m interested in AI / Machine Learning / Data Mining / Computer Vision.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning new methods to overcome Adversarial Attacks on ML models.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI projects by developing Keras / Tensorflow models.
- 📫 To reach me message via github or kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/bayram5000).


I prepare the 'theModel' for your project. Javascript example:

`import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';`

`const theModel = await tf.loadLayersModel('https://foo.bar/theModel.json');`

`const example = tf.fromPixels(webcamElement);`

`const prediction = theModel.predict(example);`
